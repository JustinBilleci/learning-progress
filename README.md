# learning-progress
 This is a log of all my progress learning how to program,use framewroks,deploy projects, etc.


*February 10th, 2024*

First Log: I am starting this repository pretty late as I have been in the process of learning programming an deployment skills since September 2023. I already have a firm grasp on HTML, CSS, and Tailwing CSS. I'm currently practicing Javascript and today revised what I know about buttons in JS as well as how to connect them to functions. Slow and steady wins the race!
