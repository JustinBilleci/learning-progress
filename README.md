 This is a log of all my progress learning how to program,use framewroks,deploy projects, etc.


*February 10th, 2024*

First Log: I am starting this repository pretty late as I have been in the process of learning programming an deployment skills since September 2023. I already have a firm grasp on HTML, CSS, and Tailwing CSS. I'm currently practicing Javascript and today revised what I know about buttons in JS as well as how to connect them to functions. Slow and steady wins the race!

Second Log: I forgot to log yesterday, but today is more of what I started yesterday. Learning to reformat arrays into more concise code on my "simple-role-playing-game". 

*February 13th, 2024* 

Third Log: today is more arrays and functions and how to make them clearer and more concise. The goal is to have my "simple-role-playing-game" completed by the end of the week, but we'll see how that goes.
