# learning-progress
 This is a log of all my progress learning how to program,use framewroks,deploy projects, etc.


*February 10th, 2024*

First Log: I am starting this repository pretty late as I have been in the process of learning programming an deployment skills since September 2023. I already have a firm grasp on HTML, CSS, and Tailwing CSS. I'm currently practicing Javascript and today revised what I know about buttons in JS as well as how to connect them to functions. Slow and steady wins the race!

*February 12th, 2024*

Second Log: I forgot to log yesterday, but today is more of what I started yesterday. Learning to reformat arrays into more concise code on my "simple-role-playing-game". 

*February 13th, 2024* 

Third Log: today is more arrays and functions and how to make them clearer and more concise. The goal is to have my "simple-role-playing-game" completed by the end of the week, but we'll see how that goes. 

*February 14th, 2024* 

Fourth Log: I feel much more confident with arrays, buttons, and functions overall. By the end of the week I'll br adding my updated code for the "simple-role-playing-game". I have high hopes for this year. 


*February 15th, 2024*

Fifth Log: I am now not going to have the "simple-role-playing-game" repository updated by the end of the week as I have recently found a new Javascript course that I believe will benefit me more. I am still going to finish the game, but at a later date TBD. I am incredibly excited for this new course and can't wait to come right back to the one I'm already on afterwards. WE GOT THIS!


*February 16th, 2024*

Sixth Log: The new Javascript course is going well and I'm learning very valuable things from someone already establihed in this field. Hoping to learn more soon but unsure since I'll be camping this weekend. Wish me luck! 


*February 19th, 2024*

Seventh Log: The new Javascript course is almost completed and I have found a lot of useful information from it. Took two days off to go and hang out with family. 


*February 20th, 2024*

Eighth Log: The new Javascript course helped a ton and I feel much more confifent moving forward. I am in the process of moving this week and won't have much time to code but I'll try my best to make do. 


*February 22nd, 2024*

Ninth Log: I haven't been able to code much recently as I have been in the process of moving, I hope to do a lot more next week. Just thought I'd update this a little for transparency.


*February 23rd, 2024*

Tenth Log: Another log for transparency, I'm unable to code again today but I am looking forward to a new REACT course I found. I'm excited to continue the process and get back on the horse once I'm done moving. 


*February 26th, 2024*

Eleventh Log: Finally moved in and will be back to coding tomorrow after I get the rest of my things. I can't wait do the REACT course, my goal is to be employed as a Software Engineer within 6 months. 


*February 27th, 2024*

Twelfth Log: Initialized some code and created the repository for the JS intro course. not much but another busy day, glad I could do some more. :)


*February 28th, 2024*

Thirteenth Log: Updated some code in my "portfolio" repository, I have high high hopes for my coding future as well as high hopes for my future job search. If you're reading this I hope you have a great day! 


*March 6th, 2024* 

Fourtheenth Log: Took a break from logging as I have been more focused on directly coding and deploying real projects. Today I took the day off as I am not at home, this is also my first log in March. I plan on starting a course on REACT soon, after the course is finished I'll finish the developement process and deploy my new gym app "Never Quit". Excited for the upcoming future. 


*March 7th, 2024*

Fifteenth Log: Made some small updates on my repository for the JS tutorial. No big changes today as I am still not at home but will be tomorrow. Have a good one :)


*March 11th, 2024*

Sixteenth Log: Excited to start the REACT course later today, that repository will be up later today as well. I am suuuuuuper excited to get the ball rolling on that and I have all week to code so I'm hoping to have a NEXT.JS course completed by the end of the week as well. UPDATE: Didn't create the REACT repo yet, that will be tomorrow. Finished JS course. If you're reading this have a great day/night! 


*March 13th, 2024*

Seventeenth Log: Created the REACT to-do list repo yesterday and should be able to finishit by the end of the day today and then on to the NEXT.JS project. I'm on track to have these finished by the end of the week still. Happy coding!


*March 14th, 2024*

Eighteenth Log: Finished the REACT to-do list! Instead of making the NEXT.JS project next, I'm going to focus on another REACT/Tailwind CSS project I have already started to get a better grasp on it as I still have so much to learn. That should hopefully be finished by the end of the weekend. Have a good one! 


*March 15th, 2024*

Nineteenth Log: Started back up on my REACT/Tailwind CSS gym app, I feel like I am grasping the concepts of Tailwind CSS and REACT a lot more and I have high hopes for the future! Short log today but nothing really crazy happened just hard work, Much Love <3


*March 16th, 2024*

Twentieth Log: Not much coding done today, just a rest day for laundry and cleaning. back on the grind tomorrow. :)


*March 21st, 2024*

Twenty-first Log: Haven't done much in terms of coding this week, created four new buttons in the REACT gym app. Placed them and styled them accordingly. Thanks for reading!


*March 26th, 2024*

Twenty-second Log: REACT gym app is taking me longer than expected, still working hard and making a lot of progress. updated some code for the gym app today. Have a good one! 


*March 27th, 2024*

Twenty-third Log: Added the third section to the front page of the gym app. Definitely going to work on a smaller project to start off learning NEXT.js. I found that these bigger projects often have equal levels of stress and learning, whereas the smaller projects have a lot more learning that gives you a better understanding of the basics with much less stress giving you the ability to move on to bigger projects and deal with them better.  


*March 28th, 2024*

Twenty-fourth Log: Updated the functionality and responsiveness of all buttons in the three main components. Looking forward to finally completing this tomorrow, Thanks for checking in!
