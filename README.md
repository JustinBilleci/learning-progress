# learning-progress
 This is a log of all my progress learning how to program,use framewroks,deploy projects, etc.


*February 10th, 2024*

First Log: I am starting this repository pretty late as I have been in the process of learning programming an deployment skills since September 2023. I already have a firm grasp on HTML, CSS, and Tailwing CSS. I'm currently practicing Javascript and today revised what I know about buttons in JS as well as how to connect them to functions. Slow and steady wins the race!

Second Log: I forgot to log yesterday, but today is more of what I started yesterday. Learning to reformat arrays into more concise code on my "simple-role-playing-game". 

*February 13th, 2024* 

Third Log: today is more arrays and functions and how to make them clearer and more concise. The goal is to have my "simple-role-playing-game" completed by the end of the week, but we'll see how that goes. 

*February 14th, 2024* 

Fourth Log: I feel much more confident with arrays, buttons, and functions overall. By the end of the week I'll br adding my updated code for the "simple-role-playing-game". I have high hopes for this year. 


*February 15th, 2024*

Fifth Log: I am now not going to have the "simple-role-playing-game" repository updated by the end of the week as I have recently found a new Javascript course that I believe will benefit me more. I am still going to finish the game, but at a later date TBD. I am incredibly excited for this new course and can't wait to come right back to the one I'm already on afterwards. WE GOT THIS!


*February 16th, 2024*

Sixth Log: The new Javascript course is going well and I'm learning very valuable things from someone already establihed in this field. Hoping to learn more soon but unsure since I'll be camping this weekend. Wish me luck! 


*February 19th, 2024*

Seventh Log: The new Javascript course is almost completed and I have found a lot of useful information from it. Took two days off to go and hang out with family.
